## ✅ Completed Milestones (newest first)

| Date | Milestone | Details |
|------|-----------|---------|
| 2026-04-24 | **dipRsiThreshold 60→45 + ADX(14)>20 filter** | P1 fixes from 22-trade analysis. Threshold targets Investopedia-cited "deep pullback in uptrend" zone (40–50). ADX filter suppresses TREND_BUY_DIP during ranging markets (Schwab/Investopedia: ADX<20 = no trend). Deployed together; monitoring 1 week before P2. |
| 2026-04-24 | **Volume confirmation for crypto TREND_BUY_DIP** | Require 15m entry-candle volume > 1.2× 20-period mean for crypto TREND_BUY_DIP. IG CFD volume unreliable — filter only applies to CRYPTO; skipped silently during warmup. Source: LuxAlgo + r/algotrading consensus. |
| 2026-04-22 | **Silent signal recording** | Per-instrument `trend-buy-dip-notify` flag — signals log to `position_outcomes` without Telegram alert. S&P 500 TREND_BUY_DIP now silent pending ≥20 trade sample. |
| 2026-04-22 | **Crypto enabled broadly** | BTC + ETH TREND_BUY_DIP re-enabled after R:R drop to 2:1 (previously unreachable at 3:1). |
| 2026-04-22 | **ATR stops + asset-class R:R + R-multiple P&L** | `AtrCalculator` on 15m; stops = ATR × 1.5 (trend) / 2.0 (other). Trend R:R now 2:1 crypto / 3:1 indices. Report €-estimate uses `pnlPct / stopPctAtEntry × riskEur` so 24h auto-closes at +P&L count correctly. Unified crypto exit timeframe to 15m (fixes the SOL 24h auto-close bug where 5m was never polled). |
| 2026-04-22 | **Open positions at top of P&L report** | Same columns as Closed table so rows align visually. Added `Realistic Net` line excluding (symbol, signalType) combos with ≥3 trades and 0 TP hits. |
| 2026-04-22 | **Candle history CSV backup** | `make candles-backup-local` / `make candles-backup-remote` dumps `candle_history` via `\copy` for offline analysis. |
| 2026-04-21 | **BTC re-enabled** | Added back to watchlist for history collection after fixing its data gap. |
| 2026-04-18 | **P&L report with EUR totals + CSV endpoint** | `GET /api/positions/pnl-report/csv`; By-instrument breakdown; Makefile `remote-report` / `remote-csv`. |
| 2026-04-17 | **Duplicate position guard** | `PositionOutcomeService.handleSignalEvent` skips creating a second open position for the same symbol. |
| 2026-04-16 | **Candle history persistence (DB)** | `CandleHistory` entity; ~2,900 candles loaded on startup; RSI accuracy preserved across restarts. |
| 2026-04-14…16 | **Trend Detection v2 + v2.1** | EMA20(1h) primary trend filter + momentum fallback + consecutive-signal fallback. TREND_BUY_DIP / TREND_SELL_RALLY signal types. Stops at half width, trend limits at 3× stop. Suppresses counter-trend signals immediately after warmup. |
| 2026-04-XX | **Deployed to AWS EC2** | Live on `108.128.230.238` (eu-west-1). See `docs/remote-deployment.md`. |
| 2026-04-XX | **ntfy.sh → Telegram migration** | Private bot `@LucidLynx1_bot`; chat-id whitelist in `TELEGRAM_CHAT_IDS`. ntfy code fully removed. |
| 2026-04-XX | **Phase 5 anomaly scaffolding** | `VolumeAnomalyDetector` (4σ), `AnomalyNotificationService`, `PolymarketMonitorService` (5-min polling, ≥8pp odds shift). |
| 2026-04-XX | **Phase 4 auto-trading scaffold** | `IGTradingService` behind kill switch + manual-approval flag + daily loss limit + max-concurrent. Hard-disabled in code. |
| 2026-04-XX | **Phase 3 Claude enrichment built** | `ClaudeEnrichmentService` wired into `NotificationService`; disabled by default. |
| 2026-04-XX | **Phase 2 IG integration** | Live spread-bet auth; 6-hour session refresh; watchlist upsert on every restart via `DataInitializer`. |
| 2026-04-XX | **Cross-asset correlation filter** | `CrossAssetCorrelationService` live — detects risk-on/off regimes (oil spiking + indices falling = risk-off) and suppresses counter-trend signals. Updates every poll cycle. |
| 2026-04-XX | **Volatility regime filter** | `VolatilityRegimeService` live — detects ATR expansion >1.5× 20-period mean across 2+ instruments and suppresses new entries during high volatility. |
| 2026-04-XX | **Polymarket discovery + monitoring** | `PolymarketDiscoveryService` (market discovery with tag/liquidity filters) and `PolymarketMonitorService` (≥8pp odds shift alerts) both live. |
| 2026-04-XX | **Phase 1 core engine** | Spring Boot + Postgres + Docker; multi-TF RSI; watchlist CRUD REST; cooldown / quiet-hours; repo renamed `rsi-alert-service → market-signals`. |

## 🎯 Active Backlog

### P1 — Do next (1–2 weeks)

| Item | Effort | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Close + Open above Summary** | ~30min | Move the full `All Closed Positions` table to just above Open in the P&L report, so both recent-trade tables are at the top before the Summary / By-Instrument sections. |
| **Periodic candle CSV export + DB cleanup** | ~2h | Extend `PriceHistoryService` trimming: keep last N days in DB, archive older rows to a dated CSV in `reports/candles/` before pruning. Frees EC2 disk without losing history. Alternative: scheduled daily `\copy` via a DB cron. |
| **RSI-bucket outcome analysis** | ~1h SQL | Once ≥2 weeks of `position_outcomes` exist, split TREND_BUY_DIP wins/losses by rsi15m bucket. If <50 fires win materially more, this confirms the RSI-threshold change above. Query in `project-log.md`. |
| **Enable Claude AI enrichment** | ~30min | Set `CLAUDE_API_KEY` + `CLAUDE_ENABLED=true`. Service already built. |
| **Telegram bot commands** | ~3h | `/position`, `/close`, `/status`, `/mute`, `/notrade` — manage service via Telegram. Admin-only via chat-id allowlist. |
| **Momentum fading detector** | ~2h | Notify "FAST TF DIVERGENCE" when 3/3 aligned but fast TFs flip. Exit-timing signal using existing RSI values. |

### P2 — Next sprint (2–4 weeks)

| Item | Effort | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **ATR-stops A/B tracking** | ~1h | Persist `stop_basis` on `PositionOutcome`; group expectancy by stop source in the report. Drives the decision to leave ATR on permanently. |
| **Stochastic confirmation layer** | ~3h | Optional %K(14,3,3) confirmation on RSI signals. Proposed logic in `project-log.md`. |
| **Self-service Telegram onboarding** | ~3h | `/start` → admin DM `/approve <id>`; hot-reload approved IDs into `TELEGRAM_CHAT_IDS`. |

### P3 — Speculative (1–3 months)

| Item | Effort | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Restore 5m crypto exit granularity** | ~1h | If 15m ever misses SOL wicks, add `5m` to SOL `timeframes` and revert `finestExitTimeframe` to the original 5m/15m split. Affects signal alignment counts — review first. |
| **High Uncertainty Mode toggle** | ~2h | **Last remaining Phase 5 item.** Suppress all but urgent full-alignment signals during elevated VIX-equivalent or macro events. |
| **Phase 4 auto-trading (enable)** | weeks | Only after 3+ months of positive paper P&L. Do not rush. |

---

## Immediate Next Actions

1. **Validate new retrospective reports** — Check `GET /api/positions/oil-review` and `GET /api/positions/momentum-review` to confirm both render correctly with current candle history.
2. **Monitor Phase 5 filters** — Watch logs for `RISK-OFF SUPPRESSED`, `RISK-ON SUPPRESSED`, and `HIGH VOLATILITY SUPPRESSED` to verify correlation + volatility filters are working.
3. **Paper trade only** — do not enable Phase 4 auto-exec.
4. **Run `make candles-backup-remote` weekly** — local CSV backup in `reports/candles/` (retain until you've validated the DB backup story).
5. **Add `CLAUDE_API_KEY`** when you want richer Telegram context.

---

## Notes

- **Data sources**: Binance (FREE, crypto) and IG (FREE with account, indices/FX/commodities/crypto). Finnhub and Twelve Data rejected — free tiers insufficient for indices coverage and rate limits.
- **Hosting**: AWS EC2 t3.micro (eu-west-1, Free Tier 12 months). Postgres self-hosted in the same Docker Compose. No RDS.
- **AI model swap**: `ClaudeEnrichmentService` is the only file to change. Gemini Flash / DeepSeek / GPT-4o-mini all cheaper than Haiku; swap when ready.

## 🔍 What to Build Next (Current Reality Assessment)

*As of May 2026, with Correlation, Volatility, Polymarket, Momentum Surge, and Oil Opportunity reports all live:*

### Worth Building Now

1. **RSI-bucket outcome analysis** (P1) — The TREND_BUY_DIP threshold was lowered to 45 on Apr 24. After 2+ weeks of data, split wins/losses by RSI15 bucket to validate the change. If <50 fires materially outperform, the threshold change was correct.

2. **ATR-stops A/B tracking** (P2) — Persist `stop_basis` on `PositionOutcome` so the P&L report can compare expectancy: ATR stops vs fixed-pct stops. This is the missing data to decide whether to leave ATR on permanently.

3. **Stochastic confirmation layer** (P2) — The one remaining unbuilt signal filter. Optional %K(14,3,3) confirmation could reduce false positives on TREND_BUY_DIP entries.

4. **High Uncertainty Mode** (P3, but small) — The *only* remaining Phase 5 item. A simple toggle that suppresses all but full-alignment signals when VIX-equivalent is elevated. ~2h to complete the Phase 5 spec.

### Probably Skip

- **Cross-instrument correlation detector** — *Already live* as `CrossAssetCorrelationService`. Risk-on/off regime detection works via price momentum, not RSI alignment counts.
- **Volatility-spike entry filter** — *Already live* as `VolatilityRegimeService`. Suppresses signals when ATR expands >1.5× across 2+ instruments.
- **Price momentum surge detector** — *Already built* as `PriceMomentumSurgeDetector`. Retrospective analysis available at `GET /api/positions/momentum-review`.
- **Telegram bot commands** — Nice-to-have, but the system already has signal recording, P&L reports, and HTTP endpoints for everything. Lower priority than signal-quality improvements.

### Strategic Observation

The system now has **more filtering/reporting infrastructure than signal-generation refinement**. The retrospective tools (oil-review, momentum-review) will reveal whether the current RSI-based approach is catching the right moves. If momentum-review shows consistent "MISSED" on surges that later became TREND_BUY_DIP winners, consider tightening RSI thresholds or adding earlier entry logic — not more filters.
