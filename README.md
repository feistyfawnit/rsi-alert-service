# LucidLynx Market Signals

A production-grade Spring Boot service that monitors financial instruments for multi-indicator alignment signals across multiple timeframes and sends instant push notifications. Combines RSI, Stochastic, volume anomalies, and geopolitical event monitoring (via Polymarket). Monitors crypto (via Binance), indices and commodities (via IG API) in real time.

**Repository:** `https://github.com/feistyfawnit/market-signals` (Private)

## Features

- ✅ Real-time RSI calculation across multiple timeframes (15m, 30m, 1h, 4h — configurable per instrument)
- ✅ Multi-instrument support (crypto via Binance, indices/commodities via IG API)
- ✅ Three-tier signal hierarchy: FULL → PARTIAL → WATCH
- ✅ Private push notifications via Telegram bot (multi-recipient, no app install needed)
- ✅ Partial signal monitoring with lagging-TF follow-ups
- ✅ No-trade mode + per-symbol muting (persistent across restarts via DB)
- ✅ Active position tracking — gates anomaly alerts until a trade is open
- ✅ Volume anomaly detection (σ-based) + Polymarket geopolitical odds monitor
- ✅ Claude AI signal enrichment (optional)
- ✅ Signal CSV archival with outcome backfill (1h/4h/24h price tracking)
- ✅ Auto P&L tracking — positions opened on signal, TP/SL checked hourly, daily markdown report
- ✅ REST API for instruments, signals, settings, positions, retrospective analysis
- ✅ Auto-trading scaffolded (Phase 4 — hard-disabled, requires demo validation)

## Deployment

- **AWS Free Tier** (primary): EC2 t2.micro in Dublin (`eu-west-1`), 12 months free, ~€15/month after
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflow for auto-deploy on push to `main`
- See `docs/remote-deployment.md` for full setup (manual or Terraform)

## Tech Stack

- Java 25
- Spring Boot 3.5.3
- PostgreSQL 16
- WebFlux for reactive HTTP calls
- Docker & Docker Compose

## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose installed

### 2. Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your values. See comments in `.env.example` for each variable.

Key settings for notifications:
```bash
TELEGRAM_ENABLED=true
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_from_botfather
TELEGRAM_CHAT_IDS=your_chat_id          # comma-separate for multiple recipients
```

### 3. Run with Docker Compose

```bash
# Build and start services
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f app

# Stop services
docker-compose down
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

### 4. Receive Alerts via Telegram

Alerts are delivered privately via the **B&I Alert Bot** (@LucidLynx1_bot) on Telegram.

**To add a new recipient:**
1. In Telegram, search **@userinfobot** and send it any message — it replies with your numeric chat ID (e.g. `Id: 987654321`)
2. Search **@LucidLynx1_bot** and tap **START** (so the bot can message you)
3. Send your chat ID to an admin — he adds it to `.env`:
   ```
   TELEGRAM_CHAT_IDS=6633143916,987654321
   ```
4. Restart: `docker-compose up -d --build`

> ⚠️ **Note:** Self-service onboarding (no admin step needed) is planned — see ROADMAP.

## API Endpoints

Full reference: **[docs/api.md](docs/api.md)**

Key endpoints:

```bash
GET  /api/instruments/enabled          # Active instruments
GET  /api/signals/recent?hours=24      # Recent signals
GET  /api/signals/rsi-snapshot          # Live RSI values
POST /api/signals/no-trade-mode/on     # Suppress PARTIAL/WATCH
POST /api/trading/kill-switch/activate  # Emergency stop
POST /api/test/notify                   # Fire test notification
```

## Pre-Configured Instruments

The app comes pre-configured with:
- **Solana (SOLUSDT)** - Binance
- **Bitcoin (BTCUSDT)** - Binance
- **Ethereum (ETHUSDT)** - Binance
- **Bitcoin Cash (BCHUSDT)** - Binance
- **DAX 40, FTSE 100, S&P 500, Nasdaq 100** - IG API
- **Gold, Silver, Oil (Brent)** - IG API

All crypto data is FREE via Binance API (no API key required). Indices/commodities require an IG account.

## Configuration

Edit `src/main/resources/application.yml` or use environment variables:

```yaml
rsi:
  period: 14                    # RSI calculation period
  oversold-threshold: 30        # Default oversold threshold
  overbought-threshold: 70      # Default overbought threshold
  polling:
    interval-seconds: 300       # Binance polling interval (5 min)
    ig-interval-seconds: 900    # IG polling interval (15 min)
  quiet-hours:
    enabled: true
    start-hour: 22              # 10 PM UTC (11 PM BST)
    end-hour: 8                 # 8 AM UTC (9 AM BST) — full signals bypass quiet hours
```

See [docs/api.md](docs/api.md) for adding instruments via the REST API.

## Signal Types

| Priority | Signal | Condition | ntfy priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 🟢 OVERSOLD / 🔴 OVERBOUGHT | All TFs aligned | urgent (5) — bypasses DND |
| 2 | 🟡 PARTIAL | All but 1 TF aligned | default (3) |
| 3 | 👀 WATCH | 1 TF crossed + others approaching | low (2) |

## Trade Duration & IG Financing Costs

IG Daily Funded Bets (DFB) accrue **overnight financing charges every calendar day** the position is held, regardless of whether markets are open. Typical cost on a crypto position:

- Daily Admin Fee: ~€0.14/day
- Daily Financing Adjustment: ~€0.38/day
- **Total: ~€0.50–0.55/day per standard position**

> **Target in-and-out within 1–4 days.** If a trade hasn't moved in your favour within 3–4 days, the carry cost alone is a valid reason to close — regardless of RSI. A week's hold costs ~€3.50+ before spread is considered.

## Troubleshooting

See [docs/troubleshooting.md](docs/troubleshooting.md) for operational troubleshooting and IG quota guidance. See [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) for first-run/demo steps. Quick checks:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health           # App running?
curl http://localhost:8080/api/instruments/enabled     # Instruments active?
curl http://localhost:8080/api/signals/recent?hours=1  # Any signals?
docker-compose logs -f app                             # Check logs
```
